# Resident Complaints - Duplicate Payment Tracking

## 🎯 **What Changed:**

The AI Billing Analysis now **only shows duplicate bills where residents have actually raised complaints** about double maintenance payments, instead of showing all possible duplicates.

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

1. **Database Filtering**: The system queries the database for bills with disputes
2. **Complaint Detection**: Filters for maintenance bills where residents complained about "duplicate" or "double" payments
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Only shows bills where residents have actively reported issues

## 📊 **Sample Data:**

The system creates sample bills with disputes like:
- "I have already paid the maintenance charges for February 2025. This is a duplicate bill."
- "I received two maintenance bills for the same month. This appears to be a system error."
- "I am being charged twice for the same maintenance period."

## 🚀 **Testing Steps:**

### 1. **Populate Sample Data**
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/populate-billing-disputes.js
```

### 2. **Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

### 3. **Login as Admin**
- Go to login page
- Use admin credentials
- Navigate to "AI Billing Analysis"

### 4. **View Results**
- You'll see only bills where residents complained
- Each entry shows the resident's name and their complaint
- Summary shows total complaints, not total duplicates

## 📈 **Expected Results:**

- **Before**: Shows all possible duplicate bills (even if no one complained)
- **After**: Shows only bills where residents actively reported duplicate payment issues

## 🎨 **UI Changes:**

- Changed "Duplicate Bills" to "Resident Complaints - Duplicate Payments"
- Added "Resident Complaint" badges
- Shows resident's actual complaint text
- Orange color scheme for complaint-related items

## 🔍 **Database Structure:**

The system looks for bills with:
```javascript
{
  type: 'maintenance',
  status: 'disputed',
  disputes: [{
    reason: 'Duplicate Payment', // or 'Double Billing', etc.
    description: 'Resident complaint text...',
    status: 'pending'
  }]
}
```

## ✅ **Benefits:**

1. **Actionable Data**: Only shows issues that need attention
2. **Resident-Centric**: Focuses on actual resident complaints
3. **Efficient Management**: Admins can prioritize based on real complaints
4. **Transparency**: Shows exactly what residents are complaining about

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. Run the populate script to create sample data
2. Test the admin dashboard
3. Verify only complaint-based duplicates are shown
4. Check that resident names and complaints are displayed correctly
